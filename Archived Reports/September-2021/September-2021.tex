\section{General Overview}
Activities for the month of September have primarily focused on two areas of our work, notably exploring techniques for analysing and interpreting flight logs and for setting up the infrastructure for running feature interaction experiments. In the following task decomposition, we have highlighted the tasks that we have worked on this month (blue), and currently inactive -- but not yet completed tasks (gray).

\section{Other Goals}
\noindent Work on the following research goals is either not yet started or in very preliminary stages:
\subsection{Safety Analysis and Assurance: }
Our  goal  is  not  only  to  detect  anomalies,  but  also  to  diagnose  them,  gain  understanding of  their  underlying  causes,  and  ultimately  to  identify  mitigations.   We  plan to  adopt  a systematic  safety-analysis  and  assurance  approach  using  Fault  Tree  Analysis  (FTA)  and Safety-Assurance Cases (SAC). {\bf No progress was been made on this goal in August.}
\subsection{ Architectural Analysis and Integration: }
A key component of this research involves evaluating existing NAS and SWIM architecturesto determine how well they can support in-time assessment functions – such as our Dronolytics  solution.  We  will  design,  implement,  and  deploy  a  highly  modular,  scalable, low-power consumption prototype system with capabilities to interface with existing NAS infrastructures. 


\section{Questions to NASA and other updates: }
No questions this month.  As a follow-up comment to last month's report, we did not submit a rebudgeting request as planned for the website development work.  This is currently not needed as CRC services are no longer assisting with the deployment.
