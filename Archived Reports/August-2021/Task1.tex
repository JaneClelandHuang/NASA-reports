\section{Data Collection and Annotation Infrastructure}
Task T1 focuses on establishing infrastructure for the project. 
Our goal is to have much of the basic infrastructure developed by the end of November. the infrastructure for uploading files and annotating them fully deployed by the end of November (Task 1.1a). To that end we have engaged in the following infrastucture building tasks:

Specific activities related to data collection infrastructure that we have performed during this period have focused on the following:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item {\bf Backend Server for Data Collection} {\it  [Task T1.1a]: } We are working with Notre Dame's Center for Research Computing (CRC) to deploy a back-end server for the data collection.  As this will be a public-facing website which allows uploading data it needs to be highly secure.  CRC has the expertise to deploy and host the server with appropriate security and backup regimes.
      \item {\bf Front-end Data Collection website: } We have started working on the front-end UI for (i) flight log data collection, (ii) visualizing log data, and (iii) both automatically and manually annotating the data to depict specific faults. This front end work has been performed primarily by two Notre Dame Undergraduate students (Patrick Creaven, Daniel Fugitt) under the supervision of PhD student Md Nafee Al Islam and PI Cleland-Huang.
The students have added many important features including file upload, flight route replay, plotting graphs of attributes whose anomalous values are often correlated with runtime faults and failures, and annotation tagging.  They have provided all required graphs for Ardupilot logs and a subset of graphs for PX4. 
    
\item {\bf Initial Data Collation} {\it  [Task 1.1b]: }
PhD student Nafee has imported 77,357 PX4 flightlogs from  \url{https://review.px4.io/browse}. While we will not make these available publicly on our website as they were collected by the PX4 project, we have added them to our flightlog analytics dataset. Our current collection therefore includes 700 Ardupilot flight logs (from our own drones), 77357 PX4 flight logs (from SOURCE), and Z additional flight logs (also from SOURCE). 
\item{\bf Onboard Infrastructure} {\it [Task 1.2a]: }
We have completed the infrastructure for our sUAS autonomous onboard pilot (px4).  While developing the autonomous pilot is funded by an NSF CPS grant, the infrastructure is now fully ready for use in our NASA work as we will be able to use it to (1) collect, analyse, and respond to flight log data in real time, (2) experiment with connectivity to a SWIM-type multi-UAS service. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Summarized Metrics}
As building a large, annotated dataset is a key goal of the project, we track progress towards this goal.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering 
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|} \hline
        &{\bf Metric} & {\bf PX4} & {\bf Ardupilot} & {\bf Other}  \\ \hline
        1.& Total No. of Physical Logs collected&77357&700&0\\ \hline
        2.& Total No. of Physical Logs collected with anomalies&?&$>$30&0\\ \hline 
        3.& Total No. of Physical Logs collected with annotated anomalies&0 &0&0\\ \hline  
        4.& Total No. of Simulated Logs collected&0&0&0\\ \hline
        5.& Total No. of Simulated Logs collected with anomalies&0 &0&0\\ \hline 
        6.& Total No. of Simulated Logs collected with anomalies labeled&0 &0&0\\ \hline  
    \end{tabular}
    \newline Note: Still analyzing all the data we imported as it lacks some meta-data.
\end{table}

\subsection*{Next Steps: }
Next month we will continue work on establishing the infrastructure - as many research activities have dependencies upon this.
