%Document X highlights a number of very real challenges associated with increased access to relevant data, integrated analysis and predictive capabilities, improved real-time detection and alerting of domain-specific hazards, decision support, and where feasible -- automated mitigation strategies. 
%%%%%%%%%%
% From the RFP - need to cover
%The goals and expected significance of the proposed research, especially as related to the objectives given in the NOFO;
%• The perceived impact of the proposed work to the state of knowledge in the field. If the proposal is a successor to an existing NASA award, the proposal must include:
%• How the proposed work expects to build on and extend previous accomplishments supported by NASA;
%• The relevance of the proposed work to the specific objectives given in the NOFO, and/or to present and/or future NASA programs and interests, such as described in current versions of the NASA Strategic Plan and/or documents from the soliciting directorate, office, or program (e.g., the Science Plan, the Strategic Technology Investment Plan, the Strategic Implementation Plan, Voyages: Charting the Course for Sustainable Human Space Exploration);
%• The technical approach and methodology to be employed in conducting the proposed research, including:
Proposed experimental designs, methods, techniques, and approaches for achieving the proposed goals and objectives of the NOFO
• A description of any hardware or software development, construction or fabrication required to carry out the research
• Sources of error and uncertainties and what effect they may have on the robustness of potential results or conclusions
• The resilience of the approach and methodology, e.g., complementary measurements, confirming tests, and approaches likely pitfalls
• Any special capabilities and advantages of facilities and equipment (a basic description list is in the facilities and equipment section)
• Technical approach and methodology impact on the budget, and 2
• The flow of the different tasks and how they feed into one another
• A general implementation plan, including:
• A project schedule that identifies anticipated key milestones for accomplishments and dependencies between tasks;
• The management structure for the proposal personnel;
• Any substantial collaboration(s);
• Any proposed use of consultant(s); and
• A description of the expected contribution to the proposed effort, by task and sub-task, by the PI and each person identified in one of the additional categories found in Appendix B, regardless of whether or not they derive support from the proposed budget, but not including the information required in the table of personnel and work effort.
The Scientific/Technical/Management Plan section may contain illustrations and figures that amplify and demonstrate key points of the proposal (including milestone schedules, as appropriate). However, they must be of an easily viewed size and resolution and have self-contained captions that do not contain critical information not provided elsewhere in the proposal.
