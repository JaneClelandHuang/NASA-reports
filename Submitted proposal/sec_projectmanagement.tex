\section{Project Management}
In this section we describe our project management plan, including team organization, support and collaboration structure, and a detailed workplan.

\subsection{Team Organization}

Two of the investigators, Chawla and Cleland-Huang, are at the University of Notre Dame, while Cohen is at Iowa State University. Each PI will have one PhD student assigned to the project and the entire team (3 Investigators and 3 PhD students) will meet together biweekly via zoom and/or in person to discuss progress.  The PI, co-PIs, and grad students will give regular informal presentations in the biweekly meetings to demonstrate progress. Collaborators are welcome to participate and will join meetings as requested.
In addition, the teams will collaborate through research exchanges. The Notre Dame team will visit Cohen at Iowa State once a year and Cohen and her student will reciprocate by visiting Notre Dame once a year. PI Cleland-Huang and Graduate student Agrawal will coordinate flight tests at Notre Dame's White Field, the South Bend Radio Control Club, and over the St. Joseph River in South Bend. All flights will be fully authorized via AirMap.  
The entire team will formally evaluate progress against milestones every six months, identify roadblocks or delays, define mitigation plans, and monitor progress of any critical path issues.  Each team (Chawla, Cleland-Huang, Cohen) will produce an interim monthly report and a detailed annual report as required by NASA, and students will be given opportunities to publish their work at professional conferences.

%\subsection{Project Infrastructure}
%The project involves research activities (primarily thrusts 1-4) as well as development activities which are distributed across the project (primarily thrust 5). All research and development activities will be conducted incrementally throughout the project with clear goals and milestones as established under `Quantified Success Criteria'. \jch{probably a bit more here}. Each PI will conduct experiments on their own servers; however, a centralized server in Cleland-Huang's lab will host the central Dronolytics server alongside their current Dronology and DroneResponse infrastructure. This will include both backend and `onboard' components for use with simulations and will provide infrastructure for pushing Dronolytics onto the companion computer of a connected sUAS.

%\subsection{Project Reporting}
%The team will provide a monthly progress report documenting results and findings. Particularly novel and interesting results will be published at conferences and/or journals throughout the project, and a final project report shall be provided at the completion of the project.  In addition, we anticipate delivering full documentation so that a reasonably competent RPIC (during alpha, beta, or after release) could deploy and test on their own sUAS.
