abstract="While wildfires continue to ravage our world, big data analysis aspires to provide solutions to complex problems such as the prevention and management of natural disasters. In this study, we illustrate a state-of-the-art approach towards an enhancement of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) surveillance for wildfire prevention and management through big data analysis. Its novelty lies in the instant delivery of images taken from UAVs and the (near) real-time big-data oriented image analysis. Instead of relying on stand-alone computers and time-consuming post-processing of the images, a big data cluster is used and a MapReduce algorithm is applied to identify images from wildfire burning areas. Experiments identified a significant gain regarding the time needed to analyze the data, while the execution time of the image analysis is not affected by the size of the pictures gathered by the UAVs. The integration of UAVs, Big Data components and image analysis provides the means for wildfire prevention and management authorities to follow the proposed methodology to organize their wildfire management plan in a reliable and timely manner. The proposed methodology highlights the role of Geospatial Big Data and is expected to contribute towards a more state-of-the-art knowledge transfer between wildfire confrontation operation centers and firefighting units in the field.",

  abstract  = "Decades of continuous efforts to address known hazards in the national airspace system (NAS) and to respond to issues illuminated by analysis of incidents and accidents have made commercial airlines the safest mode of transportation. The task of maintaining a high level of safety for commercial airlines is complicated by the dynamic nature of the NAS. The number of flights by commercial transports is increasing; air traffic control systems and procedures are being modernized to increase the capacity and efficiency of the NAS; increasingly autonomous systems are being developed for aircraft and ground systems, and small aircraft\u2014most notably unmanned aircraft systems\u2014are becoming much more prevalent. As the NAS evolves to accommodate these changes, aviation safety programs will also need to evolve to ensure that changes to the NAS do not inadvertently introduce new risks.\nReal-time system-wide safety assurance (RSSA) is one of six focus areas for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aeronautics program. NASA envisions that an RSSA system would provide a continuum of information, analysis, and assessment that supports awareness and action to mitigate risks to safety. Maintaining the safety of the NAS as it evolves will require a wide range of safety systems and practices, some of which are already in place and many of which need to be developed. This report identifies challenges to establishing an RSSA system and the high-priority research that should be implemented by NASA and other interested parties in government, industry, and academia to expedite development of such a system.",

abstract = {Obtaining spatially separated, high-frequency water samples from rivers and lakes is critical to enhance our understanding and effective management of freshwater resources. In this work, we present an aerial water sampler and assess the system through field experiments. The aerial water sampler has the potential to vastly increase the speed and range at which scientists obtain water samples while reducing cost and effort. The water sampling system includes 1) a mechanism to capture three 20 ml samples per mission, 2) sensors and algorithms for altitude approximation over water, and 3) software components that integrate and analyze sensor data, control the vehicle, drive the sampling mechanism, and manage risk. We validate the system in the lab, characterize key sensors, develop a framework for quantifying risk, and present results of outdoor experiments that characterize the performance of the system under windy conditions. In addition, we compare water samples from local lakes obtained by our system to samples obtained by traditional sampling techniques. We find that even winds of 5.8 m/s have little impact on the water sampling system and that the samples collected are consistent with traditional techniques for most properties. These experiments show that despite the challenges associated with flying precisely over water, it is possible to quickly obtain scientifically useful water samples with an unmanned aerial vehicle.},

Reducing time to defibrillation is the most important factor for increasing survival in OHCA.Unmanned aerial systems, commonly called drones, can be activated by a dispatcher and sent to an address provided by a 911 caller. The drone may carry an automated external defibrillator (AED) to the location of an OHCA so that a bystander can detach and use it. Theoretical geographical information system models have shown that drones carrying an AED can reduce response times in rural areas. However, whether they reduce response times in a real-life situation is unknown. This study compared the time to delivery of an AED using fully autonomous drones for simulated OHCAs vs emergency medical services (EMS).}",
